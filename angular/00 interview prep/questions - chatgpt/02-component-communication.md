## **2. Basic Questions**

### 1. What is component communication in Angular?

Component communication in Angular refers to the methods used for sharing data between components. Since Angular applications are typically built using multiple components, it is crucial to establish proper communication channels between them.

---

### 2. How does data flow between components in Angular?

Data flow in Angular occurs in the following ways:

- **Parent to Child:** Using `@Input()` property binding.
- **Child to Parent:** Using `@Output()` and `EventEmitter`.
- **Between Sibling Components:** Using shared services with RxJS Subjects.
- **Across Unrelated Components:** Using Angular services and state management libraries like NgRx or BehaviorSubject.

---

### 3. What is the purpose of the `@Input` decorator?

The `@Input()` decorator allows a parent component to pass data to a child component.

Example:

```ts
@Component({
  selector: "app-child",
  template: "<p>Received: {{data}}</p>",
})
export class ChildComponent {
  @Input() data!: string;
}
```

Usage in the parent component:

```html
<app-child [data]="'Hello Child'"> </app-child>
```

---

### 4. How does `@Output` work in Angular?

The `@Output()` decorator is used to send data from a child component to a parent component via event binding.

Example:

```ts
@Component({
  selector: "app-child",
  template: '<button (click)="sendData()">Send</button>',
})
export class ChildComponent {
  @Output() messageEvent = new EventEmitter<string>();
  sendData() {
    this.messageEvent.emit("Data from Child");
  }
}
```

Usage in the parent component:

```html
<app-child (messageEvent)="receiveMessage($event)"></app-child>
```

---

### 5. What is `EventEmitter`, and how is it used for communication?

`EventEmitter` is a class in Angular used with `@Output()` to emit events from a child component to a parent component.

Example:

```ts
@Output() notify = new EventEmitter<string>();
notify.emit('Message from Child');
```

---

### 6. What is the difference between `@Input()` and `@Output()`?

`@Input()` and `@Output()` are used for communication between parent and child components.

| Feature   | `@Input()`                               | `@Output()`                                             |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Direction | Parent → Child                           | Child → Parent                                          |
| Purpose   | Pass data into a child component         | Emit events from child to parent                        |
| Example   | `<app-child [data]="value"></app-child>` | `<app-child (event)="handleEvent($event)"></app-child>` |

Example:

```ts
@Input() data!: string;
@Output() event = new EventEmitter<string>();
```

---

### 7. What is `ViewChild`, and how can it be used for component interaction?

`ViewChild` allows access to a child component, directive, or DOM element within the component’s own template.

Example:

```ts
@ViewChild('childComp') child!: ChildComponent;
ngAfterViewInit() { console.log(this.child.someMethod()); }
```

Use cases:

- Accessing child component properties and methods
- Working with template reference variables
- Manipulating DOM elements

---

### 8. What is `ContentChild`, and how does it differ from `ViewChild`?

`ContentChild` is used to access projected content inside `<ng-content>`, while `ViewChild` is used for elements inside the component’s template.

| Feature        | `ViewChild`                                          | `ContentChild`                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scope          | Component’s own template                             | Content projected into `<ng-content>`                   |
| Lifecycle Hook | `ngAfterViewInit`                                    | `ngAfterContentInit`                                    |
| Example        | `@ViewChild(ChildComponent) child!: ChildComponent;` | `@ContentChild(ChildComponent) child!: ChildComponent;` |

Example of `ContentChild`:

```ts
@ContentChild(ChildComponent) child!: ChildComponent;
ngAfterContentInit() { console.log(this.child); }
```

---

### 9. How do you pass data between sibling components?

Sibling components can communicate using a shared service and RxJS Subjects.

Example:
**Shared Service:**

```ts
@Injectable({ providedIn: "root" })
export class DataService {
  private subject = new BehaviorSubject<string>("");
  data$ = this.subject.asObservable();

  updateData(value: string) {
    this.subject.next(value);
  }
}
```

**Component A (Sender):**

```ts
constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}
sendData() { this.dataService.updateData('Message from A'); }
```

**Component B (Receiver):**

```ts
constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}
ngOnInit() { this.dataService.data$.subscribe(data => console.log(data)); }
```

---

### 10. What are some common mistakes in component communication?

1. **Overusing Parent-to-Child Communication:** Instead of passing too many `@Input()` values, use a shared service.
2. **Not Unsubscribing from Observables:** Causes memory leaks. Use `takeUntil` or `async` pipe.
3. **Directly Modifying `@Input()` Data:** This can lead to unexpected behavior; use setter methods instead.
4. **Overcomplicating Sibling Communication:** Use a simple shared service rather than complex event chains.
5. **Accessing `ViewChild` Before `ngAfterViewInit`:** Leads to `undefined` errors.

---

## **3. Conceptual & Intermediate Questions**

### 11. How does Angular handle parent-to-child and child-to-parent communication?

- **Parent to Child:** Uses `@Input()` to pass data.
- **Child to Parent:** Uses `@Output()` and `EventEmitter` to send data back.

Example:

```ts
@Input() parentData!: string;
@Output() childEvent = new EventEmitter<string>();
```

---

### 12. What is an event binding, and how does it help in component communication?

Event binding in Angular allows handling DOM events in a component. It is commonly used in `@Output()` communication.

Example:

```html
<button (click)="sendData()">Click Me</button>
```

```ts
sendData() { this.childEvent.emit('Data Sent'); }
```

---

### 13. How do you use a shared service for communication between components?

A shared service allows communication between unrelated components using RxJS `BehaviorSubject`.

Example:

```ts
@Injectable({ providedIn: "root" })
export class SharedService {
  private messageSource = new BehaviorSubject<string>("");
  message$ = this.messageSource.asObservable();

  updateMessage(message: string) {
    this.messageSource.next(message);
  }
}
```

---

### 14. What is `Subject` and `BehaviorSubject` in RxJS, and how are they used for communication?

- ``: Emits values only to new subscribers.
- ``: Holds the last emitted value and emits it to new subscribers.

Example:

```ts
private subject = new Subject<string>();
subject.next('New Data');
```

```ts
private behaviorSubject = new BehaviorSubject<string>('Initial Value');
behaviorSubject.next('Updated Data');
```

---

### 15. How do you unsubscribe from an observable to prevent memory leaks in Angular?

Use `takeUntil` with `Subject` to unsubscribe.

Example:

```ts
private destroy$ = new Subject<void>();
this.observable$.pipe(takeUntil(this.destroy$)).subscribe();
ngOnDestroy() { this.destroy$.next(); this.destroy$.complete(); }
```

---

### 16. Explain how a singleton service helps in component communication.

A singleton service in Angular is a service that is provided at the root level, ensuring only one instance exists throughout the application. It facilitates communication between components, especially sibling or deeply nested components, by acting as a shared state.

Example:

```ts
@Injectable({ providedIn: "root" })
export class SharedService {
  private messageSource = new BehaviorSubject<string>("");
  message$ = this.messageSource.asObservable();

  updateMessage(message: string) {
    this.messageSource.next(message);
  }
}
```

Usage in Component A (Sender):

```ts
constructor(private sharedService: SharedService) {}
sendMessage() {
  this.sharedService.updateMessage('Hello from Component A');
}
```

Usage in Component B (Receiver):

```ts
constructor(private sharedService: SharedService) {}
ngOnInit() {
  this.sharedService.message$.subscribe(msg => console.log(msg));
}
```

---

### 17. What is the role of the `@ViewChild` decorator in accessing child components?

`@ViewChild` allows a parent component to access a child component's properties and methods, enabling direct interaction.

Example:

```ts
@ViewChild(ChildComponent) child!: ChildComponent;
ngAfterViewInit() {
  console.log(this.child.someMethod());
}
```

Use Cases:

- Accessing child component methods
- Managing DOM elements
- Triggering events in child components

---

### 18. How do you access the parent component from a child component?

A child component can access its parent component using `@Host` or `@Optional` in its constructor.

Example:

```ts
constructor(@Optional() private parent: ParentComponent) {}
ngOnInit() {
  if (this.parent) {
    console.log('Parent data:', this.parent.parentProperty);
  }
}
```

Alternatively, use an `@Input()` property to receive data from the parent component.

---

### 19. How do you implement component communication using `ngModel` with `ControlValueAccessor`?

`ControlValueAccessor` enables a component to behave like an Angular form control.

Steps:

1. Implement `ControlValueAccessor` interface.
2. Override required methods (`writeValue`, `registerOnChange`, `registerOnTouched`).
3. Use `NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR` provider.

Example:

```ts
@Component({
  selector: "app-custom-input",
  template: `<input [(ngModel)]="value" (input)="onChange(value)" />`,
  providers: [
    {
      provide: NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR,
      useExisting: forwardRef(() => CustomInputComponent),
      multi: true,
    },
  ],
})
export class CustomInputComponent implements ControlValueAccessor {
  value = "";
  onChange = (value: any) => {};
  onTouched = () => {};

  writeValue(value: any) {
    this.value = value;
  }
  registerOnChange(fn: any) {
    this.onChange = fn;
  }
  registerOnTouched(fn: any) {
    this.onTouched = fn;
  }
}
```

Usage:

```html
<app-custom-input [(ngModel)]="username"></app-custom-input>
```

---

### 20. What are the differences between `ViewChild` and `ContentChild` in component interaction?

| Feature        | `ViewChild`                                          | `ContentChild`                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scope          | Component’s own template                             | Content projected into `<ng-content>`                   |
| Lifecycle Hook | `ngAfterViewInit`                                    | `ngAfterContentInit`                                    |
| Example        | `@ViewChild(ChildComponent) child!: ChildComponent;` | `@ContentChild(ChildComponent) child!: ChildComponent;` |

Example of `ContentChild`:

```ts
@ContentChild(ChildComponent) child!: ChildComponent;
ngAfterContentInit() { console.log(this.child); }
```

**Key Differences:**

- `ViewChild` is used for querying elements within the component’s view.
- `ContentChild` is used for accessing elements projected via `<ng-content>`.
- Lifecycle hooks differ: `ngAfterViewInit` for `ViewChild`, `ngAfterContentInit` for `ContentChild`.

---

## **4. Advanced & Tricky Questions**

### 21. How would you optimize performance when passing large amounts of data between components?

- **Use Change Detection Strategies**: Set `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` to minimize re-renders.
- **Pass Immutable Data**: Use immutable objects or `Object.freeze()` to prevent unnecessary change detection.
- **Lazy Loading & On-Demand Fetching**: Load data only when needed instead of passing it through inputs.
- **Shared Services with Observables**: Use RxJS to manage large datasets instead of passing them via `@Input()`.
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Render only visible elements when dealing with large lists.

Example:

```ts
@Input() data!: ReadonlyArray<MyLargeDataType>;
```

---

### 22. How does Angular detect changes in `@Input()` properties, and what are the possible pitfalls?

- Angular detects changes using its **default change detection mechanism** (Zone.js and dirty checking).
- When `@Input()` property changes, Angular re-renders the component.
- **Pitfalls:**
  - Passing mutable objects can cause unexpected side effects.
  - If `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` is used, updates must be triggered via new object references.
  - Objects passed as `@Input()` should be immutable or replaced with new instances.

Example:

```ts
@Input() set user(value: User) {
  this._user = { ...value }; // Creating a new object reference to trigger change detection
}
```

---

### 23. What are some best practices for using services for communication in Angular?

- **Use a Singleton Service**: Provided in `root` to maintain a single instance.
- **Use RxJS Subjects/BehaviorSubjects**: For event-driven communication.
- **Avoid Excessive Service Dependencies**: Keep services focused and modular.
- **Unsubscribe from Observables**: Use `takeUntil` or `async` pipes to prevent memory leaks.
- **Use Readonly Streams**: Expose observable streams but not their `Subject` counterparts.

Example:

```ts
@Injectable({ providedIn: "root" })
export class DataService {
  private dataSubject = new BehaviorSubject<string>("");
  data$ = this.dataSubject.asObservable();

  updateData(value: string) {
    this.dataSubject.next(value);
  }
}
```

---

### 24. How does `async` pipe help with component communication?

- **Automatically subscribes and unsubscribes**: No need to manually subscribe.
- **Avoids memory leaks**: No explicit `unsubscribe` needed.
- **Simplifies templates**: Works directly in templates without `.subscribe()`.

Example:

```html
<div *ngIf="data$ | async as data">{{ data }}</div>
```

---

### 25. What is `@HostListener`, and how can it help in component communication?

- `@HostListener` listens to DOM events and binds them to methods.
- Can be used to detect global or parent component events.
- Useful for listening to window resize, scroll, or keypress events.

Example:

```ts
@HostListener('window:resize', ['$event'])
onResize(event: Event) {
  console.log('Window resized:', event);
}
```

**Use Case:**

- Communicating component state changes due to user interactions.
- Detecting external events that affect the component's behavior.

---

### 26. What is a state management library, and how does it improve communication in large-scale applications?

A state management library helps manage the state of an application in a structured and predictable manner. In Angular, libraries like NgRx, Akita, and NGXS centralize state, reducing the complexity of passing data through multiple components.

**Benefits:**

- Provides a single source of truth.
- Reduces component dependency.
- Improves debugging with tools like Redux DevTools.
- Enables time-travel debugging and state persistence.

Example using NgRx:

```ts
export const setUser = createAction("[User] Set", props<{ user: User }>());
```

---

### 27. How do you trigger changes in a component that receives data through `@Input()`?

**Methods:**

1. **Using Getter/Setter:**

```ts
@Input() set data(value: any) {
  this.processData(value);
}
```

2. **Using `ngOnChanges()`:**

```ts
ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {
  if (changes['data']) {
    this.processData(changes['data'].currentValue);
  }
}
```

3. **Manually triggering Change Detection:**

```ts
constructor(private cd: ChangeDetectorRef) {}
this.cd.detectChanges();
```

---

### 28. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using `EventEmitter` vs. RxJS `Subject` for component communication?

| Feature       | `EventEmitter`                   | RxJS `Subject`                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Purpose       | Child-to-Parent communication    | Can be used in services           |
| Async/Payload | Only emits single values         | Can handle multiple subscriptions |
| Flexibility   | Limited to event-based scenarios | More control over data flow       |

**Best Practice:** Use `Subject` for service-based communication and `EventEmitter` for child-to-parent interaction.

---

### 29. How does Angular handle event bubbling and component communication?

- **Event Bubbling:** Events propagate from child elements to parent elements unless stopped using `event.stopPropagation()`.
- **Event Binding:** Angular listens to events using `(eventName)` syntax.
- **Preventing Bubbling:**

```html
<button (click)="$event.stopPropagation(); doSomething()">Click Me</button>
```

- **Capturing Events:**

```ts
@HostListener('document:click', ['$event'])
handleClick(event: Event) {
  console.log('Document Clicked:', event);
}
```

---

### 30. Can you explain a real-world scenario where multiple communication methods might be needed within an Angular application?

**Scenario:** An e-commerce dashboard where different modules need to interact.

1. **Parent to Child (`@Input`)**: Sending product details to a product component.
2. **Child to Parent (`@Output`)**: Sending add-to-cart events to the parent.
3. **Sibling Communication (RxJS Service)**: Sharing user authentication state between header and cart components.
4. **Global State Management (NgRx/Service)**: Keeping track of cart items across routes.

Example:

```ts
@Injectable({ providedIn: "root" })
export class CartService {
  private cartSubject = new BehaviorSubject<CartItem[]>([]);
  cart$ = this.cartSubject.asObservable();
  addToCart(item: CartItem) {
    this.cartSubject.next([...this.cartSubject.value, item]);
  }
}
```

Using different techniques allows for better separation of concerns and modular design.
