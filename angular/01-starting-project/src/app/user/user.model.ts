/*
INTERFACE: An interface is a way to define a contract in your code. This contract includes the data types of the properties and methods that a class must implement.
TYPE : A type is a way to define a custom data type in TypeScript. It can be used to define the shape of an object, a function, or any other custom data type.

Interface VS Type:
1. Interfaces are used to define the shape of an object, while types are used to define custom data types.
2. Interfaces can be extended, while types can be aliased.
3. Interfaces can be implemented by classes, while types cannot.
4. Interfaces can be used to define optional and required properties, while types cannot.
