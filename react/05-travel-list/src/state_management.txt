------- Fundamentals of State Management -------------
1. What is State Management ?
Deciding when to create a piece of state, what type of states are necessary, where to place eaxh piece of state, and how data flows through the app.

Two types of state in react
1. Local state 
  > Only needed only by one component or few componenents (child componenents)
  > State that is defined in a component and only that component and child components have access to it (by passing via props)

2. Global state
  > State that many component might need.
  > Shared state that is accessible to every component in the entire application.
