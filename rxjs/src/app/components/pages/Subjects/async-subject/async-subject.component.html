<p>The AsyncSubject is a variant where only the last value of the Observable execution is sent to its observers, and only when the execution completes.</p>
<p>When the subject is completed, then it emits the last emitted value.</p>
<p>The AsyncSubject is similar to the last() operator, in that it waits for the complete notification in order to deliver a single value.</p>
