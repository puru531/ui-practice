<p>Creates the Observable lazily, that is, only when it is subscribed.</p>
<p>defer allows you to create an Observable only when the Observer subscribes. It waits until an Observer subscribes to it, calls the given factory function to get an Observable -- where a factory function typically generates a new Observable -- and subscribes the Observer to this Observable. In case the factory function returns a falsy value, then EMPTY is used as Observable instead. Last but not least, an exception during the factory function call is transferred to the Observer by calling error.</p>
