<p>Projects each source value to an Observable which is merged in the output Observable, emitting values only from the most recently projected Observable.</p>
<p>Maps each value to an Observable, then flattens all of these inner Observables using switchAll.</p>
<p>Returns an Observable that emits items based on applying a function that you supply to each item emitted by the source Observable, where that function returns an (so-called "inner") Observable. Each time it observes one of these inner Observables, the output Observable begins emitting the items emitted by that inner Observable. When a new inner Observable is emitted, switchMap stops emitting items from the earlier-emitted inner Observable and begins emitting items from the new one. It continues to behave like this for subsequent inner Observables.</p>

<p>while inner observable is emiiting the values, in between if new value is emitted by source observable,
 then it will leave emiiting that and start emitting with new emiited value from source observable</p>
