<p>concat joins multiple Observables together, by subscribing to them one at a time and merging their results into the output Observable. You can pass either an array of Observables, or put them directly as arguments. Passing an empty array will result in Observable that completes immediately.</p>
<p>concat will subscribe to first input Observable and emit all its values, without changing or affecting them in any way. When that Observable completes, it will subscribe to then next Observable passed and, again, emit its values. This will be repeated, until the operator runs out of Observables. When last input Observable completes, concat will complete as well. At any given moment only one Observable passed to operator emits values. If you would like to emit values from passed Observables concurrently, check out merge instead, especially with optional concurrent parameter. As a matter of fact, concat is an equivalent of merge operator with concurrent parameter set to 1.</p>

<p>If any Observable in chain errors, instead of passing control to the next Observable, concat will error immediately as well. Observables that would be subscribed after the one that emitted error, never will.</p>
