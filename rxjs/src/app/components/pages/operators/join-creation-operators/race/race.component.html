<p>whichever observale will complete first, will be emitted.</p>
<p>Returns an observable that mirrors the first source observable to emit an item.</p>
<p>race returns an observable, that when subscribed to, subscribes to all source observables immediately. As soon as one of the source observables emits a value, the result unsubscribes from the other sources. The resulting observable will forward all notifications, including error and completion, from the "winning" source observable.</p>
<p>If one of the used source observable throws an errors before a first notification the race operator will also throw an error, no matter if another source observable could potentially win the race.</p>
<p>race can be useful for selecting the response from the fastest network connection for HTTP or WebSockets. race can also be useful for switching observable context based on user input.</p>
