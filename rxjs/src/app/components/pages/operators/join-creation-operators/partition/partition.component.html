<p>Splits the source Observable into two, one with values that satisfy a predicate, and another with values that don't satisfy the predicate.</p>
<p>It's like filter, but returns two Observables: one like the output of filter, and the other with values that did not pass the condition.</p>
<p>partition outputs an array with two Observables that partition the values from the source Observable through the given predicate function. The first Observable in that array emits source values for which the predicate argument returns true. The second Observable emits source values for which the predicate returns false. The first behaves like filter and the second behaves like filter with the predicate negated.</p>
