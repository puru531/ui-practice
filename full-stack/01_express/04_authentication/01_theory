5. Hashing

- Hashing is a process of converting a plain text into a random value.
- Hashing is a one way process, meaning once a plain text is hashed, it cannot be converted back to plain text.
- Hashing is used to store passwords in a database.
- Hashing is used to check the integrity of data.
- Hashing is used to generate a unique value for a given input.
- A single input will always generate the same output.

2. Encryption

- Encryption is a process of converting a plain text into a cipher text.
- Encryption is a two way process, meaning a cipher text can be converted back to plain text.
- Encryption is used to secure data during transmission.
- Encryption is used to secure data at rest.
- Encryption is used to secure data in transit.
- Encryption is used to secure data in a database.
- Encryption requires a key to encrypt and decrypt data.

3. JWT (JSON Web Token)

- JWT is a standard for creating access tokens.
- JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
- JWT is used to authenticate users.
- JWT is used to authorize users.
- JWT is used to securely transmit information between parties.
- It takes JSON as input and returns a token.
- Tokens are easily convertible to JSON.

4. Local Storage

- Local storage is a web storage that allows you to store data in the browser.
- Local storage is persistent, meaning the data will not be lost when the browser is closed.
- Local storage is used to store data on the client side.
- Local storage is used to store data temporarily.
- Local storage is used to store data that is not sensitive.
